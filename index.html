			<p>I am a graduate student in the School of Geography and Development at the University of Arizona. I am currently pursuing my Master's of Arts with specific interests in ecophysiology and phytogeography. I came to Tucson with an interest in working with <a href="http://www.barrongafford.org/">Dr. Greg Barron-Gafford</a>, and it is with the resources and assistance of his lab group that I am able to explore my <a href="projects.html">thesis project</a>.</p>
			<p align="center">--</p>
			<p>Before moving to Arizona, I received my Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Sciences at San Diego State University. While an undergraduate, the Environmental Sciences program allowed me flexibility in what topics I wanted to explore beyond the classroom. I was fortunate to develop a relationship with faculty in the <a href="http://fs.sdsu.edu/">Field Stations Program</a>, who exposed me to field methods in ecology and watershed management.</p>
			<p>In my sophomore year at SDSU, I became a field technician with the <a href="http://gcrg.sdsu.edu/">Global Change Research Group</a>, led by Dr. Walter Oechel. Working with the GCRG was an excellent opportunity to surround myself with scientific exploration and new techniques in observing ecosystem processes. By the time I finished my degree in 2013, I had taken four trips to the Arctic to maintain and repair long-term eddy covariance systems operated by our lab group. </p>
			<p>After graduating, Dr. Oechel (along with Dr. Donatella Zona) agreed to hire me as the full-time lead technician for the GCRG. I worked between Alaska and San Diego for two years (making six more trips to the Arctic in that period), and during that time I was responsible for:
				<li>Managing all of the field work done by members of our lab group and visiting researchers.</li>
				<li>Regularly organizing and carrying out multi-day excursions to remote research sites to ensure that instruments were working correctly.</li>
				<li>The development of new study sites and a <a href="media/2013_AGU_murphyfacsimile.pdf">new method</a> of obtaining accurate, reliable CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from the tundra.</li>
				<li>Assisting with several graduate student projects across Southern California.</li></p>
			<p align="center">--</p>
			<p>Despite my involvement in the Arctic, I had a desire to focus my interests on semi-arid ecosystems similar to those I grew up in. Southern Arizona provides an excellent living laboratory to study ecosystem dynamics in a stressed environment. I am currently investigating how small variations in topography control primary production in a mixed conifer forest. My research should feed into work done by investigators in the <a href="http://criticalzone.org/national/">Critical Zone Observatories</a> program.</p>
