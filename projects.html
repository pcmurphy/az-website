				<p>Capturing productivity is important to this project, as they provide a quantitative measure of how these species are responding to their environment. The LiCor LI-6400 shown here is being used to measure photosynthesis and transpiration rates for a Douglas Fir sample in Spring, 2016.</p>

			<p>My primary interest when starting with the Barron-Gafford Lab was to investigate the impact of environmental drivers on ecosystem health and productivity. Semi-arid environments, such as those found in Arizona, are particularly interesting regions to study because vegetation has already adapted to tolerate broad variation in enironmental conditions. Changes to these drivers push these species to the edges of their tolerances. Although changing climatic conditions are important to consider, I am also curious about the influence topography has on productivity. Variation in this state factor is not often included in descriptions and models of ecosystem function, especially not small variations. The focus of my thesis project is to determine to what extent topography controls the productivity of a community.</p>
			<p>Based on work done through the Critical Zone Observatories, it is known that the movement of energy and material through a system varies depending on aspect. Northern aspects, with less direct solar radiation and generally more moisture, support greater flux of energy and material. But, what is the relation of this to net primary productivity? To address this, we are investigating catchment-level variability in vegetation response to environmental conditions. The <a href="http://criticalzone.org/catalina-jemez/infrastructure/field-area/bigelow-tower/">study site</a> is a mixed conifer forest in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, AZ. The topography of this site is such that native species (<i>P. menziesii, P. ponderosa, P. strobiformis</i>) are found on both the southern and northern aspects of a 1.5 hectare zero-order basin. This allows us to stratify samples by both aspect and species. We are taking leaf-level measurements of productivity for these individuals on a seasonal basis, as determined by temperature and water availability.</p>
			<p>We expect to find differences in how these individuals respond to environmental conditions depending on which aspect they are found. In addition, we anticipate differences in these reactions between species in the same catchment. The results of this project will provide a better understanding of the heterogeneity in ecosystem function and response to climate change.</p>
